# Private Bee – GPS 4D Navigation System 🐝

## Project Description

GPS 4D is an innovative navigation system designed for **drones**, **air taxis**, and more generally for **next-generation aircraft** used in urban air mobility.

Unlike traditional navigation systems that rely on three-dimensional positioning (latitude, longitude, altitude), GPS 4D introduces a fourth essential dimension: **time**.

The objective of this project is to design a system capable of **planning**, **optimizing**, and **monitoring** aerial trajectories while simultaneously considering:

- **airspace geometry**,
- **regulatory constraints**,
- **real-time weather conditions**,
- **movements of other aircraft**,
- and **the urgency level of the mission**.

The system computes the **optimal trajectory** not only in **space** but also in **time**, in order to ensure **safer**, **faster**, and **more efficient** flights. It is also designed to dynamically adapt to **unexpected events** such as potential collisions, weather changes, restricted airspaces, or emergency situations.

## Getting Started

Before contributing, please read:
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)

---

## Prerequisites

There are **no prerequisites** for this repository since it only contains **documentation**.

For other repositories, refer to their **README** for prerequisites.

---

## Conventions

The **coding conventions** for this project are described in [CONVENTIONS.md](./CONVENTIONS.md). Please **read them before starting** to work on the project.

---

## Git & GitHub Workflow Tutorial

To learn everything about using Git, GitHub, and the workflow you need to follow, please refer to the [GIT-GITHUB-WORKFLOW-TUTORIAL](./GIT-GITHUB-WORKFLOW-TUTORIAL.md) file.

---

## Templates

### Pull Request and Issue Templates

In the [.github](.github/) directory, you can find **templates for pull requests and issues**. These templates **streamline your workflow** and **save you time**.

You can **modify the pull request template** as needed to adapt it to your project.

For issue templates, you can **add new ones** by creating a new **.yml file** following the structure from existing template files. This way, you can create issue templates for any type of issue you need.

---

### Repository Template

#### Purpose 

The [privatebee-template](https://github.com/PrivateBee/privatebee-template) repository serves as a **template for creating new repositories**. 

This template provides **essential files** that should be in every repository, such as the **license**, **governance documents**, **code of conduct**, and more.

It also includes a **README file** with **predefined sections** that you can complete based on your specific project needs.

---

#### Using the Repository Template

To use the repository template, click on the **New repository** button in the **repositories tab** of the project, and in the **configuration section**, select **privatebee-template**.

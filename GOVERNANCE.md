# Private Bee Governance

This document defines the governance structure of the **Private Bee** initiative. It describes how decisions are made, how responsibilities are assigned, and how the project evolves over time.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

Private Bee is a collaborative, open-source initiative involving multiple academic institutions and contributors. This governance applies to all repositories under the Private Bee organization unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

## 2. Governance Model

Private Bee follows a **merit-based and collaborative governance model**.

Decisions are made primarily by consensus among maintainers. When consensus cannot be reached, a structured decision process is applied.

The project aims to balance:
- academic freedom,
- technical quality,
- long-term sustainability.

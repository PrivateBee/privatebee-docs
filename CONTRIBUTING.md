# Contributing to PrivateBee 🐝

Private Bee is a collaborative, open-source initiative focused on 4D navigation, safety, and optimization for aerial vehicles.

This document describes the general guidelines for contributing to any Private Bee project.

---

## General Guidelines

Contribution rules may vary depending on the specific Private Bee project you are working on. This document provides **global contribution guidelines** intended to ensure a consistent and efficient workflow across the entire Private Bee initiative.

Each repository may define additional or more specific contribution rules.
When contributing to a particular project, always refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file located in the corresponding repository for project-specific guidelines.

## 1. Who Can Contribute

Contributions are welcome from:
- Students involved in Private Bee partner schools
- External contributors (subject to review)

All contributions must align with the goals of the Private Bee initiative.

---

## 2. Types of Contributions

You can contribute in many ways, including:
- Code (features, bug fixes, refactoring)
- Documentation and diagrams
- Tests and simulations
- Issue reporting and discussions
- Conceptual or architectural proposals

Not all contributions require coding skills.

---

## 3. Contribution Workflow

The general contribution workflow is:

1. Check existing issues or open a new one if necessary
2. Create a branch from the main branch
3. Make your changes following the project guidelines
4. Commit your changes with clear messages
5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
6. Address review comments if needed

Large or structural changes should be discussed in an issue before implementation.

---

## 4. General Quality Guidelines

Please ensure that your contribution:
- Is clear, readable, and documented when relevant
- Respects the existing architecture
- Does not introduce unnecessary complexity
- Includes tests or examples when possible

Maintainability and clarity are prioritized over cleverness.

## 5. Coding and Collaboration Conventions

General conventions across Private Bee projects:
- Use English for code, comments, and documentation
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep Pull Requests focused and limited in scope
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single PR

Repository-specific conventions may apply.

---

## 6. Issues and Discussions

- Use issues to report bugs, request features, or propose ideas
- Be clear and precise when describing problems
- Provide context, screenshots, or examples when applicable

Constructive discussion is encouraged.

## 7. Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow the
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Respectful and inclusive behavior is mandatory.

---

## 8. Project Governance

Private Bee is governed according to a defined governance model that describes roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes.
